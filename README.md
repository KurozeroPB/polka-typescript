Testing polka in typescript

Wanted to try out polka using typescript so I wrote some simple typings, they could definitely be improved but it gets the job done for now.

Just clone the repo if you want to try it out yourself. \
`git clone git@github.com:KurozeroPB/polka-typescript.git && cd polka-typescript`

Then install the modules with either commands, I prefer yarn \
`yarn install` or `npm install`
